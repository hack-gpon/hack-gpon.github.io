- V3.0.10N06 (TIM Italy) - Internal version is V3.0.10P2N6

## List of partitions

This ONT supports dual boot, as visible from the presence of `kernel0` and `kernel1`, which contain the rootfs (JFFS2 read-only).
The boot images can be swapped if they are the same or use the same **U-Boot** version. If you have a different **U-Boot** that was paired with the active image, do not attempt this, as it will brick the ONT, specially if TTL console is disabled.

```sh
upgradetest switchver X
```

Where `X` can be `0/1`, based on the image you want to boot from.

Get current installed version for each region:

```sh
upgradetest getver
```

You can also clone the currently running image into the other slot using this command:

```sh
syn_version
```

You can check currenlty running image using this command:

```sh
# cat /proc/csp/versionstates

baseaddress    : 0x1b00000
current        : 0
version1states : 0x83
version2states : 0x83

And check if the backup image has a valid CRC:

```sh
# upgradetest bakver
backup version crc is ok
success!
```


# Use
{% include alert.html content="Commands have been tested on V3 HW rev. on OpenFiber and TIM firmwares" alert="Note"  icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

## Enable Telnet
{% include alert.html content="This is an external script ([ZTE ONU Telnet Enabler](https://github.com/stich86/zteOnu)), use at your own risk! Credentials don't survive at reboot!" alert="Note"  icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

```sh
./zteOnu -i 192.168.1.1 -u admin -p admin
```

If Telnet is not opening, you are probably running a newer firmware, in that case change mac-address of the NIC connected to the ONT to `00:07:29:55:35:57` and use the flag `--new`:

```sh
./zteOnu -i 192.168.1.1 -u admin -p admin --new
```

You should get this output and credentials to login over telnet:

```sh
ZteONU 0.0.7, built at 09/10/2024
source: https://github.com/stich86/zteOnu
-----------------------------------
step [0] reset factory: ok
step [1] request factory mode: ok
step [2] send sq: ok
step [3] check login auth with user: ok
step [4] enter factory mode: ok
-----------------------------------
Success authenticated with user: admin and password: admin
Telnet Credentials (!! Temporary !!)
User: 9qNBo58H
Pass: OUBToR8J
```

## Enable console redirection

To see omcidebug messages on telnet, execute this command (just the first time of each connection):

```sh
redir printf
```

# GPON ONU status

## Getting the operational status of the ONU

To check the connection status, use the following command:
```
gpontest -gstate
```
`[gpontest] gpon state is [O5]` for O5 state

## Getting  OLT vendor information

```sh
sendcmd 132 omcidebug showmedata 131
```

This command will print the following output:

```sh
##################################
MIB INFO:
         ME CLASS: 131
         DB NAME: olt_g, DBHandle: 32

```

## Querying a particular OMCI ME

```sh
sendcmd 132 omcidebug showmedata ID_MIB (eg. 7 for Firmware version)
```

This command will print the following output:

```sh

# GPON/OMCI settings

## Getting ONU GPON Serial Number
```sh
setmac 2 2176
setmac 2 2177
```

## Setting ONU GPON Serial Number

{% include alert.html content="Both S/N and VID have to be changed. 2176 is for the VID (first 4 letters of the S/N) and 2177 is for the last 8 digits of the S/N" alert="Note"  icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}
```sh
setmac 1 2176 ZTEG
setmac 1 2177 AABBCCDD
```

## Getting ONU GPON PLOAM password

```sh
setmac 2 2181
setmac 2 2178
```

## Setting ONU GPON PLOAM password 

{% include alert.html content="The PLOAM password is stored in the ASCII format." alert="Note"  icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

This can be done easily via the Web UI. 
{% include image.html file="f6005v3/f6005v3_ploam_change.jpg" alt="F6005v3 Ploam Change" caption="F6005v3 Ploam Change" %}

To do it via the shell use:
```sh
setmac 1 2181 1234567890
setmac 1 2178 1234567890
```



## Setting ONU GPON Equipment ID

```sh
setmac 1 32770 "5::F6005V3.0:"
```

## Check Images CRC

```sh
upgradetest bakver

backup version crc is ok
success!

```

## Persistent Telnet access 

{% include alert.html content="This procedure was only tested on OF V3.0.10P3N2 and TIM V3.0.10N06 firmware and it's persistent after an upgrade from OLT" alert="Note"  icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

{% include alert.html content="If you change GPON Serial Number, Telnet will be disabled. You have to run again the tool to enable it" alert="Note"  icon="svg-warning" color="red" %}

Needed tools:

[ZTE ONU Telnet Enabler](https://github.com/stich86/zteOnu)

Just run the enabled with `--telnet` flag to make Telnet persisten across Reboot (use `--new` flags and changed mac-address for newer firmware):

```sh
./zteOnu -i 192.168.1.1 -u admin -p admin --telnet
```

```sh
ZteONU 0.0.7, built at 09/10/2024
source: https://github.com/stich86/zteOnu
-----------------------------------
step [0] reset factory: ok
step [1] request factory mode: ok
step [2] send sq: ok
step [3] check login auth with user: ok
step [4] enter factory mode: ok
-----------------------------------
Success authenticated with user: admin and password: admin
Permanent Telnet succeed
User: root
Pass: Zte521
Wait reboot.. or powercycle it
```

The ONT will reboot, and you can log in later using `root\Zte521` as the credentials.

**Only for firmware versions with restricted admin access**

In case you want add new a admin user instead of using the embedded credentials, run these commands before rebooting the ONT:

```sh
sendcmd 1 DB set DevAuthInfo 5 Enable 1
sendcmd 1 DB set DevAuthInfo 5 User superadmin
sendcmd 1 DB set DevAuthInfo 5 Pass superadmin
sendcmd 1 DB set DevAuthInfo 5 Level 1
sendcmd 1 DB set DevAuthInfo 5 AppID 1
sendcmd 1 DB saveasy
```

Reboot the ONT and you can login to the WebUI using `superadmin\superadmin` as credentials with full unlocked menus.

# Advanced settings

## Backing up ONT partitions using hardware flasher

It's possible to swap RAW dump between ONTs and enable access over Telnet to modify some ONT parameters.

Needed tools:

- Windows, Linux or macOS with [SNANDer](https://github.com/McMCCRU/SNANDer)
- [CH341a programmer with 3.3V voltage](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/1005004637577204.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.21ad51c1Lmyq6Z&algo_pvid=0aade75d-7f57-4fe7-b0f4-b3f2f56af9f1&algo_exp_id=0aade75d-7f57-4fe7-b0f4-b3f2f56af9f1-0&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21EUR%214.25%214.25%21%21%214.56%214.56%21%4021039cc717284006273332970e47ea%2112000029927819932%21sea%21IT%211864988329%21X&curPageLogUid=Xuv1aOCo58M9&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)
- [Pogo-Pin Probe for WSON8 8x6mm chip](https://it.aliexpress.com/item/1005006666230520.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.21.11e236965SstMd&gatewayAdapt=glo2ita)

Connect all needed cable from the probe to the programmer, then attach the probe to the chip (use some rubbers to make it stable) and run this command to dump the NAND:

```sh
/SNANDer -r f6005v3_dump_X.bin
```

Do at least 3 dumps and compare their md5 to be sure that are good.

If you want to flash this dump to another ONT, just run these commands:

```sh
/SNANDer -e
/SNANDer -w f6005v3_dump_X.bin -v
```

## Changing region code

{% include alert.html content="Be aware that changing the region code may break features such as PPPoE depending on your ISP, and remove Telnet access!" alert="Note"  icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

ZTE has created various region codes that load default values based on the local ISP. This configuration can be changed using this command:

```sh
upgradetest sfactoryconf X
```

Where X is the number of supported regioncode into file `/etc/init.d/regioncode`, here is an example from TIM `V3.0.10N06` firmware:

```sh
# cat /etc/init.d/regioncode
14:Thailand
97:ItalyTi
116:Tescali
154:Izzi
163:BrazilClaroHome
188:HollandKpnSfu
198:Manufacture
2074:ItalyFastwebSFU
```

# Random notes
- This new ONT (and probably the XGSPON version as well) has Secure Boot enabled. All headers contain an RSA key that is verified by U-Boot and the CPU (for U-Boot itself), so there’s no way to repack the rootfs to make it fully spoofable (at the moment..).
- If your ONT is updated by the OLT (e.g., an F6005v3 OpenFiber ONT connected to a TIM OLT), the U-Boot partition will also be updated. After this update, it will no longer be possible to switch to the other partition because the signatures will not match, and TTL console is muted after U-Boot start.

[^1]: Credentials are randomly generated by ZTE ONU Telnet Enabler, they are not persistent and will change at reboot.
[^2]: Serial console is read-only mode on most of U-Boot, and no output after kernel load. For OF V3.0.10P3N2 is possible after pressing ESC during the boot to access U-Boot Console.
