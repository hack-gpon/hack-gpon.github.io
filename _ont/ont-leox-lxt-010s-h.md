This stick supports dual boot. 

`k0` and `r0` respectively contain the kernel and firmware of the first image, `k1` and `r1` the kernel and the firmware of the second one

## Serial Console


The stick has a TTL 3.3v UART console (configured as 115200 8-N-1)  that can be accessed from the top surface. To accept TX line commands, GND of TTL adapter should be attached to the stick's shield:

# /etc/scripts/flash get LAN_IP_ADDR
LAN_IP_ADDR=192.168.2.1
# /etc/scripts/flash set LAN_IP_ADDR 192.168.1.1
 ```

## Getting/Setting the ONT's S/N
```sh
# /etc/scripts/flash get GPON_SN
GPON_SN=LEOX00000000
# /etc/scripts/flash set GPON_SN TMBB0A1B2C3D
```

## Getting/Setting the ONT's PLOAM password

{% include alert.html content="The PLOAM password is stored in ASCII format" alert="Info" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

```sh
# /etc/scripts/flash get GPON_PLOAM_PASSWD
GPON_PLOAM_PASSWD=AAAAAAAAAA
# /etc/scripts/flash set GPON_PLOAM_PASSWD AAAAAAAAAA
```

## LAN SDS Mode (with firmware V3.3.4L4rc1):

|       mode           |             description              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| LAN_SDS_MODE = 1     | 1GbE with auto-neg on                |
| LAN_SDS_MODE = 7     | 1GbE with auto-neg off               |
| LAN_SDS_MODE = 8     | 2.5GbE with auto-neg off             |

If you try to use a mode not listed here, stick will use 1 as default

to change the link mode use this command:

```sh
# /etc/scripts/flash get LAN_SDS_MODE
LAN_SDS_MODE=1
# /etc/scripts/flash set LAN_SDS_MODE 1
```

# Known Bugs

Stock firmware doesn't work @ 2.5GbE. There is a new firmware avaliable from LeoLabs that fix this issue
