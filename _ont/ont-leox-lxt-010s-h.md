This stick supports dual boot. 

`k0` and `r0` respectively contain kernel and firmware of the first image, while `k1` and `r1` contain kernel and firmware of the second one.

## Serial

The stick has a TTL 3.3v UART console (configured as 115200 8-N-1) that can be accessed from the top surface. To accept TX line commands, the GND of the TTL adapter should be attached to the stick's shield:

{% include alert.html content="Some USB TTL adapters label TX and RX pins the other way around: try to swap them if the connection doesn't work." alert="Note"  icon="svg-warning" color="yellow" %}

## List firmware version

{% include alert.html content="There is a new firmware provided by LeoLabs that fixes issues with the stick operating at 2.5GbE speeds" alert="Note" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

- V3.3.4L3
- V3.3.4L4rc1 (Fix 2.5GbE HiSGMII)
- V3.3.4L4rc5
- V3.3.4L4 (Added failover from 2.5GbE to 1GbE, other fixes)
- V3.3.4L4V (Same as V3.3.4L4 but should be used for VEIP profiles)
- V3.3.4L5rc1 - This version adds "auto-negotiation" capability to the stick. It always prefers 1G (to keep the stick consistently accessible). When you force the link to 2.5G (disabling auto-negotiation), it takes at least 40 seconds to establish the connection.

# Known Bugs

The stock firmware doesn't work at 2.5GbE. There is a new firmware provided by LeoLabs that fixes this issue.
