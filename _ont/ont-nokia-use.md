Once you're logged in, a custom menu will be shown and you'll be able to access the linux shell by first typing `system` followed by `shell`:

```sh
ONT>enable
#ONT>login
User name:ONTUSER
Password: ****
```

The enable password can be generated using the following form:

{% include cig_password.html username="ONTUSER" %}

# Access Full Shell

To access a complete linux shell just type:

To exit the shell and reach the parent menu type `exit` or `x`, in each menu the `help` command will show how to use the shell
