# Curiosity

In the USA the ex BellSouth network deploys some ONTs labelled 'ALT Optics' that use a different wave length, 1310 nm for upstream and 1550 nm for downstream (instead of 1490 nm).
This was done to make a quick conversion of a network with low fibre capacity, allowing the same fibre to be reused for multiple services: FTTH and FTTC/IFITL[^att_alt_optics_1],[^att_alt_optics_2],[^att_alt_optics_3].

This is one of the few ONTs that has a variant that works with this wavelength.
