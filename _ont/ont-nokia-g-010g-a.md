# Curiosity

In the USA, the ex-BellSouth network deploys some ONTs with a 'ALT Optics' label that use a different wave length, 1310 nm for upstream and 1550 nm for downstream (instead of 1490 nm).
This was done to be able to quickly convert a network with low fibre capacity while allowing the same fibre to be reused for multiple services contemporarily: both FTTH and FTTC/IFITL[^att_alt_optics_1],[^att_alt_optics_2],[^att_alt_optics_3].

This is one of the few ONTs that has a variant that works with this wavelength.
