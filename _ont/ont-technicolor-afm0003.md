## Serial

The stick has a TTL 3.3v UART console (configured as 115200 8-N-1) that can be accessed from the top surface. To accept TX line commands, the GND of the TTL adapter should be attached to the stick's shield:

This stick supports dual boot. 

`k0` and `r0` respectively contain the kernel and firmware of the first image, `k1` and `r1` the kernel and firmware of the second one

{% include_relative ont-luna-sdk-useful-commands.md flash='/etc/scripts/flash' ploam='ascii' speedLan='12345' customSpeedLanAlert='The defualt firmware does not allow modification of the `LAN_SDS_MODE` parameter. Is it necessary to use the modded firmware. Before editing the speed make sure your hardware supports it.' lastgoodHs=true %}

## Enabling the Web UI
```sh
# /bin/iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
```

## Transfering files from/to the stick
Works with binary files too, just run md5sum on source and destination to make sure you are not corrupting anything...
From the stick to the PC:
```sh
# tftp <IP>
tftp> put <filename> <directory>
tftp> q
```
From the PC to the stick:
```sh
# tftp <IP>
tftp> get <filename>
tftp> q
```

## Extracting and repacking the rootfs
{% include alert.html content="Make sure you run both commands as root, otherwise you might get a damaged rootfs image" alert="Warning" icon="svg-warning" color="red" %}

```sh
# unsquashfs mtd5.bin
# mksquashfs squashfs-root rootfs -b 131072 -comp lzma -no-recovery
```
## Flashing a new rootfs

{% include alert.html content="Only the inactive image can be flashed, change sw_versionX and sw_commit X based on the bank you have flashed" alert="Info" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

So mtd4/5 if you are on image1, mtd6/7 if you are on image0.

The following commands are used to flash a new rootfs to image1 and then boot to it
```sh
# flash_eraseall /dev/mtd7
# cat /tmp/rootfs.new > /dev/mtd7
# nv setenv sw_version1 NEW_SOFTWARE_VERSION
# nv setenv sw_commit 1
# reboot
```
