## Serial

The ONT has a TTL 3.3v UART console (configured as 115200 8-N-1) that can be accessed from the top surface. To accept TX line commands, the GND of the TTL adapter should be attached to the ONT's shield:

## List of software versions
- V6.0.10N14 (TIM)
- V6.0.10N20 (TIM)
- V6.0.10P2N02 (OpenFiber)
- V6.0.10P2N18 (OpenFiber)

## Enable password

{% include alert.html content="The following enable password is used to enter GponCLI over a serial connection. The models currently distributed in Italy by TIM and OpenFiber have no way to enter GponCLI via serial, only via telnet after flashing a custom firmware. The enable password is not useful for accessing the Web Gui." alert="Note" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

You can use this tool to generate the enable password:

{% include cig_password.html username="ont" %}

# Advanced settings
## Unlock serial and TELNET

This ONT is the twin brother of [CIG G97-CP](/ont-cig-g-97cp), if you can find its bootloader (named `CIG_bu.en_V3.09.15`), you can easly repack the firmware and enable its serial port. 
You need a 3.3V SPI programmer (like a modded CH341a) to read and write back the flash.

{% include alert.html content="This was tested only on a TIM V6.0.10N20 firmware!" alert="Note" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

After you got a full dump of your ONT, here is the procedure to replace the original bootloader with the CIG one enable the serial port:

Cut old bootloader:
```sh
dd if=flash_dump.bin of=no_boot_flash_dump.bin bs=1 skip=184064
```

Attach the new one:
```sh
cat CIG_bu.en_V3.09.15 no_boot_flash_dump.bin > mod-boot_flash_dump.bin
```

Now you can flash the file `mod-boot_flash_dump.bin` back to your SPI. 

After powering up the ONT, the serial port will print this message:

```sh
**************************************
*                                    *
*  KEY -- Enter console terminal     *
*                                    *
**************************************
```

To access full U-Boot a special escape sequence is needed. 

If you use TeraTerm software, create a simple MACRO file that contains this code:

`send $1B $1D $0F $0B`

Configure TeraTerm with the correct serial parameters (refer to **Serial** paragraph), select the created MACRO file **BEFORE** powering up the ONT but **DON'T OPEN IT NOW**, power-up the ONT and when you see the above message, quickly open the macro to reach the U-Boot prompt:

```sh
9601D#
```

{% include alert.html content="Note that this proceedure needs to be done each time you power-cycle the ONT" alert="Note" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

Now with the U-Boot prompt a custom firmware that enable TELNET can be flashed. 
Please note that if you use a **TIM** or **OpenFiber** base firmware, the TTL will be silent after kernel loading because it was disabled at kernel level.

Here is the procedure to flash a custom firmware on your ONT via the U-Boot console:

- Attach your ONT via ethernet cable to your PC and configure it to have IP **192.168.1.2**
- Launch TFTP server and place custom firmware inside its root folder renamed into `cramfs.img.crc`. Be sure that the file has this name, otherwise the upgrade procedure will stop immediately
- Run this command on U-Boot prompt:

```sh
9601D# upgdimage
start : 0x00200000 size :0x00700000
Using LUNA GMAC  device
TFTP from server 192.168.1.2; our IP address is 192.168.1.1
Filename 'cramfs.img.crc'.
Load address: 0x80400000

{% include alert.html content="Please note that some OLTs (like Alcatel with TIM in Italy) needs to have software image 0 or 1 as active. So in this case you have to do these commands twice to flash image on both slot:" alert="Note" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}


**ImageA**:

```sh
set activeimage imagea
saveenv
``` 

and flash image with the `upgdimage`

**ImageB**:

```sh
set activeimage imageb
saveenv
``` 

and flash image with the `upgdimage`

So you will have both slot with the same firmware version and avoid the swap from the OLT

After these steps, you can power-cycle ONT and logon on TELNET with `root\admin` credentials. From this moment you can simply spoof your ONT with the usual commands.


# Known Bugs

In versions V6.0.10N14 and V6.0.10P2N02 buffer size is suboptimal: because of this the ONT is unable to work at full speed during uploads if the server is geographically, and/or latency-wise, far. There are no known problems if there is only one person in the GPON tree.
