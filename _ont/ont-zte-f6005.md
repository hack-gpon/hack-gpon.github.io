## Serial

The ONT has a TTL 3.3v UART console (configured as 115200 8-N-1) that can be accessed from the top surface. To accept TX line commands, the GND of the TTL adapter should be attached to the ONT's shield:

## List of software versions
- V6.0.10N14 (TIM)
- V6.0.10N20 (TIM)
- V6.0.10P2N02 (OpenFiber)
- V6.0.10P2N18 (OpenFiber)
- V6.0.10P2N19 (OpenFiber)

## Enable password

{% include alert.html content="The following enable password is used to enter GponCLI over a serial connection. The models currently distributed in Italy by TIM and OpenFiber have no way to enter GponCLI via serial, only via telnet after flashing a custom firmware. The enable password is not useful for accessing the Web Gui." alert="Note" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

You can use this tool to generate the enable password:

{% include cig_password.html username="ont" %}

# Advanced settings
## Unlock serial and TELNET

This ONT is the twin brother of [CIG G97-CP](/ont-cig-g-97cp), if you can find its bootloader (named `CIG_bu.en_V3.09.15`), you can easly repack the firmware and enable its serial port. 
You need a 3.3V SPI programmer (like a modded CH341a) to read and write back the flash.

{% include alert.html content="This was tested only on a TIM V6.0.10N20 firmware!" alert="Note" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

After getting a full dump of your ONT, here is the procedure to replace the original bootloader with CIG's to enable the serial port:

Cut old bootloader:
```sh
dd if=flash_dump.bin of=no_boot_flash_dump.bin bs=1 skip=184064
```

Attach the new one:
```sh
cat CIG_bu.en_V3.09.15 no_boot_flash_dump.bin > mod-boot_flash_dump.bin
```

Now you can flash the file `mod-boot_flash_dump.bin` back to your SPI. 

After powering up the ONT, the serial port will print this message:

```sh
**************************************
*                                    *
*  KEY -- Enter console terminal     *
*                                    *
**************************************
```

To access full U-Boot a special escape sequence is needed. 

If Tera Term is used, create a simple MACRO file that contains this code:

`send $1B $1D $0F $0B`

Configure Tera Term with the correct serial parameters (refer to **Serial** paragraph), select the created MACRO file **BEFORE** powering up the ONT but **DON'T OPEN IT NOW**, power-up the ONT and when you see the above message, quickly open the macro to reach the U-Boot prompt:

```sh
9601D#
```

{% include alert.html content="Note that this proceedure needs to be done each time you power-cycle the ONT" alert="Note" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

Now with the U-Boot prompt a custom firmware that enables TELNET can be flashed. 
Please note that if a **TIM** or **OpenFiber** base firmware is used, the TTL will be silent after kernel loading because it is disabled at kernel level.

Here is the procedure to flash a custom firmware on the ONT via the U-Boot console:

- Attach the ONT via ethernet cable to your PC and configure it to have IP **192.168.1.2**
- Launch TFTP server and place custom firmware inside its root folder renamed into `cramfs.img.crc`. Be sure that the file has this name, otherwise the upgrade procedure will stop immediately
- Run this command on U-Boot prompt:

```sh
9601D# upgdimage
start : 0x00200000 size :0x00700000
Using LUNA GMAC  device
TFTP from server 192.168.1.2; our IP address is 192.168.1.1
Filename 'cramfs.img.crc'.
Load address: 0x80400000

{% include alert.html content="Please note that some OLTs (like TIM's Alcatel OLTs in Italy) need to have software image 0 or 1 set as active. So in this case, these commands will have to be executed twice to flash the image on both slots:" alert="Note" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}


**ImageA**:

```sh
set activeimage imagea
saveenv
``` 

And flash image with the `upgdimage`.

**ImageB**:

```sh
set activeimage imageb
saveenv
``` 

And flash image with the `upgdimage`.

This way both slots will have the same firmware version and will avoid any swap by the OLT.

After these steps, power-cycle ONT and login via TELNET with `root\admin` credentials. From this moment you can simply spoof your ONT with the usual commands.


# Known Bugs

The buffer size of the hardware is suboptimal: because of this the ONT is unable to work at full speed during uploads if the server is geographically and/or latency-wise far. There are no known problems if there is only one subscriber on the GPON tree. 
In versions V6.0.10N14 and V6.0.10P2N02 this problem is felt more than with newer firmware as in the new versions (V6.0.10N20, V6.0.10P2N18, V6.0.10P2N19), an attempt is made to avoid buffer filling by means of pause frames. Not all routers support pause frames and some may still suffer from problems with the latest updates.

In version V6.0.10P2N18, problems were found in download speeds with 1 Gbps links.
