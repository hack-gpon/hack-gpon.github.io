# Usage

## Enable password

{% include alert.html content="The following enable password is used to enter GponCLI, but currently in the models distributed in Italy by TIM and OpenFiber there is no way to enter GponCLI either by SSH, Telnet or Serial. The enable password is not useful for entering the Web Gui." alert="Note" icon="svg-info" color="blue" %}

You can use this tool to generate the enable password:

{% include cig_password.html username="ont" %}

# Known Bugs

In versions V6.0.10N14 and V6.0.10P2N02 buffer size is suboptimal: because of this the ONT is unable to work at full speed during uploads if the server is geographically, and/or latency-wise, far. There are no known problems if there is only one person in the GPON tree.
