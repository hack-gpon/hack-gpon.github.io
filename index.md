Most ONTs run customized firmware which implem vendor and ISP-specific integrations and are locked down in functionality to match service requirements.
ONTs often perform differently depending on the OLT and the settings applied by the ISP; for convenience it is often necessary to switch from an external ONT to an SFP or vice-versa, but most OLTs perform so many checks on the ONT making a simple replacement impossible.
