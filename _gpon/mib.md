The OMCI standard is defined in a way such that suppliers can offer modular and incremental functionality to meet different levels of customer needs.

The [^G_988] and [^G_984_4] standards define the protocol needed to handle all the features of the PON specifications ([^G_984_1], [^G_987], [^G_9807_1], ...), as well as a number of services and functionalities.
The standard was born with B-PON, then modified with G-PON and separated with XGS-PON. OMCI supports interoperability, yet it allows for optional components and future extensions.

A protocol-independent MIB (Management Information Base) describes the exchange of information across OMCI [^G_988] and [^G_984_4]. This protocol is defined in terms of MEs. MEs are abstract representations of resources and services in an ONU. Only a small subset of the list of MEs is mandatory.

The existence of other MEs depends on the architecture and feature set supported by the vendor's [^G_988] and [^G_984_4]. Major ISPs and vendors have created their own extensions for MIBs [^att_open_omci], [^verizon_open_omci].

Each ME consists of an entry ID and zero, one or more instances. Each instance has its own ID, usually starting at 0, but this is not always the case. Every instance has one or more attributes, each characterised by ID, size and content.

Various MEs are often interrelated. Clause 8.2 of [^G_988] and [^G_984_4] shows the relationship graphs between the various MEs.
Clause 9 of [^G_988] and [^G_984_4] describes how the various MEs are created. There are formally 2 modes: a managed entity which is auto-instantiated by the ONT or a managed entity which is instantiated on explicit request by the OLT.
In each of the 2 cases the various MEs can be: (R), (W). Only for MEs auto-instantiated by the ONT there is also (R, W) while only for MEs auto-instantiated by the OLT there are also (R, Set-by-create), (W, Set-by-create), or (R, W, Set-by-create).

| Mode                  | Description [^G_984_4]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| (R)                   | On instantiation of the managed entity (either autonomously or on request of the OLT via a create action), the ONT sets the attribute to a default value. The OLT can only read the value of the attribute. In case of an autonomous attribute value change, the ONT will send an attribute value change notification to the OLT.                                         |
| (W)                   | On instantiation of the managed entity (either autonomously or on request of the OLT via a create action), the ONT sets the attribute to a default value. The OLT can only write the value of the attribute. In case of an autonomous attribute value change, the ONT will NOT send an attribute value change notification to the OLT.                                    |
| (R, W)                | On instantiation of the managed entity (either autonomously or on request of the OLT via a create action), the ONT sets the attribute to a default value. The OLT can both read and write the value of the attribute. In case of an autonomous attribute value change, the ONT will send an attribute value change notification to the OLT.                               |
| (R, Set-by-create)    | On instantiation of the managed entity (by necessity on request of the OLT via a create action), the ONT sets the attribute to the value specified in the create command. Subsequently, the OLT can only read the value of the attribute. In case of an autonomous attribute value change, the ONT will send an attribute value change notification to the OLT.           |
| (W, Set-by-create)    | On instantiation of the managed entity (by necessity on request of the OLT via a create action), the ONT sets the attribute to the value specified in the create command. Subsequently, the OLT can only write the value of the attribute. In case of an autonomous attribute value change, the ONT will NOT send an attribute value change notification to the OLT.      |
| (R, W, Set-by-create) | On instantiation of the managed entity (by necessity on request of the OLT via a create action), the ONT sets the attribute to the value specified in the create command. Subsequently, the OLT can both read and write the value of the attribute. In case of an autonomous attribute value change, the ONT will send an attribute value change notification to the OLT. |


The following table is the result of combining the various tables in Table 8-1, Table 11-2 of [^G_984_4], Table 8-1, Table 11.2.4-1 of [^G_988], Table 1 of [^att_open_omci], Table B1 of [^verizon_open_omci].

The new ME introduced in G.988 [^G_988] do not have a description because G.988 abolished a summary description. In the corresponding ITU Clauses, all attrubits are described, and their purpose.
