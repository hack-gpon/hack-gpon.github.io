# Fiber Optic Connectors

Numerous connectors, both standard and proprietary, are used in the field of telecommunication equipment, data lines, television and cable, and other industrial fields.

## Polishing of Fiber Optic Connectors

APC and UPC are different polishing of fiber optic ferrules, and are types of fiber patch cable connectors. Which determine the quality of the fiber optic lightwave transmission, mostly performed in optical return loss and insertion loss[^wolon].

{% include image.html file="quick-start/apc-upc.jpg" alt="Picture of APC and UPC" caption="Picture of APC and UPC" %}

Angled physical connectors are used in the ONT side to reduce back reflections. In case RF signal (1550nm) is introduced there will be two signals traveling in the downstream direction (1490nm + 1550nm), since RF systems are highly sensitive to reflections then the APC connectors reduce the return loss value[^zyxel].

Next generation systems are planned to operate in over 1500 nm wavelengths, converting APC connectors on the ONT side into planning to the future[^zyxel].

# PON Networks[^huawei]

- PON is a kind of passive optical network featuring one-to-multiple-point architecture;
- PON is short for Passive Optical Network;
- PON consists of Optical Line Terminal (OLT), Optical Network Unit (ONU) and Passive Optical Splitter.

- APON: ATM Passive Optical Networks;
- EPON: Ethernet Passive Optical Networks;
- GPON: Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Networks;
- XG(S)-GPON: 10 Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Networks[^standardxgpon];

EPON and GPON are complementary and compete against each other in some aspects. So in the following contents, we'd like to make clear the EPON and GPON comparison [^fs].

## Why GPON?

- GPON is defined by ITU, International Telecomunication Union[^standardgpon].
- GPON supports Triple - play service, providing competitive all-service solution[^huawei].
- GPON supports high-bandwidth transmission to break down the bandwidth bottleneck of the access over twisted pair cables, so as to satisfy the requirements of high-bandwidth services, such as IPTV and live TV broadcasts[^huawei].
- GPON supports the long-reach (up to 20 km) service coverage to overcome the obstacle of the access technology over twisted pair cables and reduce the network nodes[^huawei].
- With complete standards and high technical requirements, GPON supports integrated services in a good way[^huawei].
- GPON is the choice of large carriers in the international market[^huawei].
- GPON is high broadband efficiency, like 92%[^huawei].
- GPON has integrated QoS handling that makes it better than EPON, because EPON QoS is high cost relative to GPON[^fs].
- GPON supports splitting up to 1:128, XG(S)-PON up to 1:256[^fs],[^standardxgpon].
- Security: the data transmitted down to ONUs/ONTs are encrypted based on the AES mechanism[^telecom].


## Why EPON?
- EPON is defined by IEEE 802.3 standard, ratified as 802.3ah-2004 for 1.25 Gbps (1.0 Gbps prior to 8B/10B coding) and IEEE 802.3av standard for 10Gbps (10G-EPON)[^standard1epon],[^standard10epon].
- 1/1-EPON supports splitting up to 1:32, 10/*-EPON up to 1:128[^fs],[^standard10epon].
- In EPON, both downstream and upstream line rates are 1.25 Gbps, but due to the 8B/10B line encoding, the bit rate for data transmission is 1 Gbps[^medium].
- The use of EPON allows carriers to eliminate complex and expensive ATM and Sonet elements and to simplify their networks, thereby lowering costs to subscribers. Currently, GPON equipment costs are approximately 1.5 to 2 times higher than an EPON[^medium],[^fs].

## Layer 

Layering model and the associated management services are all mapped over Ethernet (directly or via IP). 

- GPON support the encapsulation of other protocols besides Ethernet, such as ATM[^cisco],[^huawei],[^fs].
- XG(S)-PON remove the support of ATM encapsulation[^telecom].
- GPON use two layers of encapsulation are required. First, TDM and Ethernet frames are wrapped into GTC Encapsulation Method (GEM) frames, which have a GFP-like format (derived from Generic Frame Procedure ITU G.7401). Secondly, ATM and GEM frames are both encapsulated into GTC frames that are finally transported over the PON[^medium],[^fs].
- The main purpose of the GEM frame is to provide a frame-oriented service, as an alternative to ATM, in order to efficiently accommodate Ethernet and TDM frames. With GEM, all traffic is mapped across the GPON network using a variant of SONET/SDH GFP. GEM supports a native transport of voice, video, and data without an added ATM or IP encapsulation layer. That's why GPON supports downstream rates as high as 2.5 Gbps and upstream rates from 155 Mbps to 2.5 Gbps. It is much faster than EPON[^medium]. 
- However, EPON clearly offers a much simpler and more straightforward solution than GPON. The support of ATM and the double encapsulation of GPON serve no real benefit over a pure Ethernet transport scheme[^medium].
- In EPON, Ethernet frames are carried in their native format on the PON, which greatly simplifies the layering model and the associated management. EPON employs a single layer that uses IP (Internet Protocol) to carry data, voice, and video[^medium],[^fs].

## Comunication between ONT and OLT[^fs]

- EPON utilizes IEEE 802.3ah OAM messages for provisioning, fault isolation and performance monitoring in conjunction with SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) sets and gets through IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) and MIBs (Management Information Bases). Additional control messages are MPCP GATEs/REPORTs for bandwidth granting.
- In GPON there are three different types of control messages: OMCI (ONT Management and Control Interface), OAM, and PLOAM (Physical Layer OAM). Their roles are shown in the table below.

| Control channel | Format          | Used for                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OMCI            | Ethernet or ATM | Provisioning of ONT service defining layers above the GTC                                                          |
| Embedded OAM    | Header overhead | BW granting, encryption key switching, and DBA                                                                     |
| PLOAM           | ATM             | Auto discovery and all other PMD and GTC management info. PLOAM messages are directed to ONTs or FF for broadcasts |


## Wavelength[^huaweimultiplexing]

PON adopts Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology, facilitating bi-direction communication over a single fiber.

To separate upstream/downstream signals of multiple users over a single fibre, PON adopts two multiplexing mechanism:
- In downstream direction, data packets are transmitted in a broadcast manner;
- In upstream direction, data packets are transmitted in a TDMA manner.

# Classes for laser[^cisco]

| ------------ | ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
| Minimum loss | 5 dB    | 10 dB   | 13 dB    | 15 dB   |
| Maximun loss | 20 dB   | 25 dB   | 28 dB    | 30 dB   |

The requirements of a particular class may be more stringent for one system type than for another.
